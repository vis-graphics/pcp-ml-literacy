The disadvantage of a scatterplot matrix is when there are more than two variables, the graph can become very complex and we need to draw a lot of graphs.

The advantage of the parallel coordinate chart is that we see the correlation of the data and the data density at the same time.

A disadvantage of parallel coordinate charts is that too many variables or lines may cause confusion when reading data. However, this disadvantage can be eliminated thanks to the filtering data feature. But, I think the data may still look very complex for some variables.

Advantage:

Visualization of Multiple Relationships: The scatterplot matrix is used to visualize relationships between multiple variables in a dataset. By having scatterplots in each cell, it allows for a quick assessment of potential connections between variables. This serves as a powerful tool to understand complex relationships among multiple variables in a dataset.
Disadvantage:

Dataset Size: Scatterplot matrices can increase in complexity when working with large datasets. Creating a matrix that displays relationships of each variable with others can result in a large matrix. This can reduce the interpretability of the visualization, especially when dealing with large datasets. For large datasets, creating subsets with fewer variables might be a more manageable approach.
Parallel Coordinates for Advantage and Disadvantage:

Advantage:

Visualization of Multiple Variables: Parallel coordinates are an effective method for visualizing multiple variables in the same graph. Each axis represents a variable, and lines between axes display relationships between variables. This is a powerful tool for understanding multiple variables in a dataset.
Disadvantage:

Complexity: Parallel coordinates can become complex, especially with datasets that contain numerous variables. As the number of axes and intersections between lines increase, the interpretability of the visualization may decrease. This complexity can make it challenging to identify specific patterns, particularly in large and intricate datasets. Careful examination may be required, especially when dealing with a high number of axes.

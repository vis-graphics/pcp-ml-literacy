-Color legend missing.
-Too much data causes to blind other legend colors for instance axis: t-start and t-end axis:
red ones preventing from seeing blue ones ,orange ones, green ones","The problems within this chart:
-Axis labels are too small to read
    -In addition some labels are not relatable with U.S Traffic Fatalities thus unnecessary axis
     for instance: beertax, religions(mormon,baptis)
    -Some label names is lacking from indicating anything
     for instance: fatal,nfatal,sfatal,fatal1517...pop,pop1517...etc
-Same axis data is not fit for the normalization (income,spirits etc)
-Too much data prevents other legend colors become visible for instance: emppop beertax",Colored figure (1.Picture) is the best candidate for visualization chart for the species because it uses color legend thus we can observe the differences and correlations between the species.,12,5,12,5
